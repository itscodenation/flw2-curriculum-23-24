# Lesson 2.9: Project Work Time (Optional)

<br>
This lesson is meant to be almost entirely dedicated to project work time, and it is the last block of work time students are scheduled to have on this project.

You could add a review to this lesson if there’s a particular React concept or skill you’d like to go over with students before they have project work time.
